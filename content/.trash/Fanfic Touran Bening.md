In the year 2205, Historical Revisionist seeking to change the course of history, have begun their offensive in the past. As a retaliation, the Government of Time dispatched saniwa across different time periods to protect history. Being able to sense spiritual energy, saniwa has the ability to bring out the tsukumogami spirits residing within swords, the Touken Danshi. Together, the saniwa has dedicated themselves to fighting to protect the course of history. “... that’s what was written here. But from what we experience, we are the only one doing the job here.” Doudanuki said while throwing away the sortie manual he just read. “Watch your words. No matter what you said, the Saniwa is our current master.” Hasebe said sternly. As summer passed, the temperature around the citadel has risen rapidly. The usually warm engawa become scorching hot, making the residents hides inside the tatami room for refuge. Inside the big tatami room, several swords lay limply without any energy. Tea set and empty plates on a low table. “You keep saying that, but you know what I said is right. When is the last time the saniwa visits us? Six-seven months ago?” Doudanuki snapped back. “Doudanuki-san, even if the Saniwa rarely come back, the Saniwa has done so much for us!” Akita said. Maeda followed, “That’s right! When Sayo first manifested, he barely talking to everyone except the Saniwa. Now Sayo already best friends with us! Isn’t it, Sayo?” The blue haired tantou nodded, “That’s indeed the case.” “Yes, yes, yes… I know, I know! I’m just stating a fact here! There’s barely any sortie and we are cooped up here! We will be rusty if we are not going to battle!” Yamanbagiri Kunihiro fiddled the tip of his hood, deep in thought. Their saniwa has been very elusive since the founding of the citadel. A few swords, like him, has been fortunate to know and live with the saniwa. After all, there’s only a handful of them in the beginning and not many manpower to do all the chores. However, since the citadel grew in size, the presence of saniwa slowly diminish. A few days absence turns into a few weeks, then a month, and now... “At least they still remember to takes our sortie and expedition reports, and our daily needs. As for sorties… There are none scheduled nor any mission issued.” Yamanbagiri chimed in. Just as silence fills the room, the smell of sakura starts to linger in the air. The swords raised their heads to the direction of a tori gate. Sakura petals swirl rapidly as the body of six touken danshi appeared. Each bring stacks of good on their hands. “OI! Come here and help us!” Nihongo almost shouted. A few touken danshi soon come and takes the crates away, each one full of tamahagane and koban. “So many resources?” Yamanbagiri asked. Midare Toushirou shows a toothy grin, “Yes! The place that the saniwa mentioned in their expedition notes is a rich iron sand deposit! We also managed to found some koban stash along the way!” Tsurumaru nods, “It’s certainly a pleasant surprise, since koban is hard to find in that era. Aruji surely know their stuffs!” The quite atmosphere become lively as the crates of supplies are taken away. Amidst the crowd, Nihongo finds Yamanbagiri awfully quiet. “... anything bothering you?” The hooded sword tilts his hood down even further, “Nothing much.” he murmurs. Nihongo scoffed, “Spill it. If you keep quiet, I won’t know what you are thinking, Mr. Head Secretary. Afterall, it is stated by our Master that even the appointed Captain of first team is under the jurisdiction of the Head Secretary.” Since the Saniwa rarely comeback to the citadel, they make a special group of touken danshi that hold the authority to manage the citadel in their absence. “The Secretary Council”, they named it. As the first sword to manifest, Yamanbagiri Kunihiro has been appointed as the Head Secretary. “Nothing you should be worried about, Nihongo. As long as we do our job properly, nothing else matter.” Yamanbagiri said. “Of course,” Nihongo replied, “as long as I can drink my sake.” before walking into the building. Eight crates of tamahagane were added into the citadel’s resource storage. With a small note in hand, Hasebe dutifully records everything. Including the stash of 800 koban Midare found during their expedition. He needs to quickly save all of it before some random drunk sword use it to buy more sake! “Alright. It will save us a lot of hassle for a period of time.” Hasebe said. He puts back the small note inside his jump suit pocket. “The storage is almost full. The next expedition should focus more on gathering koban stash.” Yamanbagiri chimed in. Hasebe scoffed, “It’s even better if they stopped spending it for useless things! Can you talk some sense to those drunkards?! The last time I tried to do it, they treat me like air!” “They can’t help it.” Both of them walk away from the storage, “They have gained immunity for your scoldings.” Hearing what the hooded sword said, Hasebe snorted. As the so-called Head of Secretary Council, Hasebe expect Yamanbagiri to at least able to reign the other touken danshi more. Most of the resident, while never resort to something extreme, still brought headache to him. “Why did aruji manifested such swords in the first place…” he grumbled. Instead of following Yamanbagiri back to the tatami room, he decides to go back to his office. While he called it an office, it’s actually more of an archive room. The saniwa asked the government to block out a section of their citadel’s library and transform it into an office for the Secretary Council. He gathered up the scattered report papers and tidies it up. Picking up an empty report form, he writes the things described by the expedition team. The report has the year, era, place, and swords dispatched, both for sorties and expeditions. For a year, he has taken the mantle to do the reports. The saniwa has been dutiful to do it, but Hasebe can’t stop himself. Perhaps, his sense of obligation is too strong. After all, it’s for his current master. And that precisely why he always feels annoyed by Yamanbagiri. Why did that guy have to be appointed as the Head Secretary? Why did the Saniwa trust him so much to manage the citadel? Is it because he manifested earlier than him? His pen suddenly caved in and spilled some ink on the report paper. He quickly grabs a tissue paper and dab the ink, but the report paper is beyond saving. Exhaled loudly, he crumpled the report and throw it to the nearest trash bin. “… before I go, there’s something I want to announce.” The saniwa solemnly said. The murmurs in the dining hall gradually quieten. Everyone’s attention is on the saniwa, including him. The saniwa swept his gaze around the room, “as you know, I’ve been rarely staying in the citadel. Thus, there are not many things that I can do to manage this place. Most citadel will choose the captain of the first team as the secretary, but I don’t think it will be enough.” Some quick-witted touken danshi already understand where the conversation is going. Hasebe, of course, almost beaming with joy. While he is the eighteenth to come to the citadel, he has been assisting the saniwa with paper works. Sometimes, he even took all-nighters together with the saniwa to ensure all the sortie reports are written and archived correctly. “Thus, I will make a Secretary Council to manage the citadel in all aspect. The captain of Secretary Council will be the Head Secretary and hold the highest authority. Five permanent members will be chosen, and the sixth member will be the captain of the first team. I think that pretty much covers everything.” The saniwa opened a small note, “The Head Secretary will be…” ‘Let it be me!’ “… Yamanbagiri Kunihiro.” Hasebe clenched his fist. “Still feel salty about Yamanbagiri?” Yagen’s sudden question startled Hasebe. His clenched fist released. “What are you doing here?” He almost snapped. “Relax! Afterall, I’m also one of the members of the Secretary Council. It’s not weird if I stayed here.” Said Yagen while entering the room. He swaggered into one of the desks placed in the corner and sits down. Pulling a note book, the tantou begins to writes. Hasebe eyed the tantou, “As the Head of Medic Team, you barely need anything here. Just spill it out.” Yagen smirked, “Barely doesn’t mean I don’t need anything here.” He said as he finishes writing. Yagen placed one arm on the table and returned the gaze from the uchigatana across him. “Let me guess. You are still sulking because general didn’t choose you as the Head Secretary.” Hasebe scoffed, “You wish. I simply can’t comprehend why they chose him, but sulking? Definitely not. After all, what I do is simply for the well-being of our current master.” Yagen chuckled. “Everyone in the citadel knows about it, so you don’t have to pretend like you don’t care. Besides, I think the general is right for choosing Yamanbagiri.” The tantou saw Hasebe fold his arms in front of his chest, but doesn’t seem to want to say anything. “As the first sword to manifest, his position in the citadel is the most secure out of anyone. What I mean is, even if they didn’t blatantly show it, they still give Yamanbagiri another level of respect. And this is without talking about the title of ‘Head Secretary’ in the first place. Why? You also know the reason. For as long as I remember, Yamanbagiri has always been the captain of the first team. Every new sword will be guided by him in their first sortie. So, when a new sword come, they will always have the impression that Yamanbagiri is a strong, or maybe even the strongest sword in this citadel.” Yagen continues. “Now that the title ‘Captain of the First Team’ is held by Izuminokami Kanesada, making Yamanbagiri as the Head Secretary is just the right choice and convenience.” Hasebe fell silent. He doesn’t want to admit it, but he knew what Yagen said is right. When he manifested, the first team led by Yamanbagiri has been the pillar of power in the citadel. The second and third team where he stationed only held the expedition post. Yamanbagiri Kunihiro, as the captain, without a doubt was and is an excellent leader. He knows that. Since he also went to his first sortie under Yamanbagiri’s leadership. “The conclusion is… just believe in the general’s decision. There’s a reason why they did what they did. Maybe one day, you will be appointed. But if you never appointed as the Head Secretary, then I’m sure the general has a reason.” Yagen finishes. The tantou continues to scribbled on the notes, leaving Hasebe deep in thought. Compared to Yagen, the second to manifest, of course their level of closeness to the Saniwa is different. Sighing, he decides to put the matter in the back of his head and take another blank report form. As the sun sets, the citadel’s kitchen and dining hall become more crowded. Shokudaikiri Mitsutada, Kasen Kanesada and Souza Samonji has been preparing bowls and plates of food. Sayo Samonji, Akita Toshirou and Maeda Toushirou running around bringing the bowls and plates to trays. “This season’s harvest is good. I’ve been craving for these cucumbers and broccoli since last season!” said Kasen while plating the cucumber salad and soup. “The apricot is also ripened. Tomorrow, I will ask the fieldwork team to harvest them and make pickled apricot.” Souza adds. Shokudaikiri hums in content, “hmm… The edamame also needs to be harvested. I think we can make zunda mochi as the snack next time.” Plating the last few bowls of rice and grilled fish, they put the last few dinner sets on the countertop. “Do you think we should spare a set for aruji?” Kasen said suddenly. The bustling in the kitchen paused. Everyone slowly turned to Shokudaikiri, the “Head Chef”. Kasen pointed on the dishes on the countertop, “You make one extra dish.” Shokudaikiri looked at the neatly arranged dinner set in front of him. Counting the one still on the countertop, there are twelve set. Meanwhile, five trays have been filled. Each one contains six dinner sets. In total, there are 42 set of dinner set, but there are only 41 touken danshi. “Ah… I’m afraid it will be another leftover...” noticing his error, Shokudaikiri said softly. He let out a chuckle, “It can’t be helped. Just say we prepared it in case anyone care for an extra portion.” The other four sword fell silent hearing the tachi’s word. As they continue to work in silence, many footsteps start to be heard around the dining hall. It’s not long until Shishiou’s head appeared behind the opened kitchen door. “Is the food ready? You need any help?” “You can help us bring out the food and I will spare one portion for Nue.” Shokudaikiri answered cheerfully, as if his previous gloominess never exists. The golden haired tachi and the creature on his shoulder both grinned, “You promised, okay!” Three tantous and one tachi quickly brought the diner sets to the waiting touken danshi in the dining hall. After every tray of food has sent out, the kitchen once again fell into silence. The extra set of food still placed neatly on top of the countertop “… sorry for asking that question. Afterall, it’s been a long time since the Saniwa has come back.” Kasen starts. Shokudaikiri keeps wiping the stove, while Souza finish washing the pans and pots. “Sometimes,” Souza takes of the gloves he’s been wearing, “I wonder what the Saniwa is thinking…” He gripped the fabric covering the demon-lord symbol on his chest, “As the symbol of the ruler of the land, I once think the Saniwa will treat me just like every other ruler did. Imagawa Yoshimoto, Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu.” He lets out a chuckle, “I guess this I what they call abandonment?” Shokudaikiri inhales sharply, “Don’t say that! If Aruji truly wants to abandon us, then, they won’t leave us with so many resources, war tactics, and battle notes. Aruji taught us how to reads, writes…” his voice cracked slightly, “…and cooks… Aruji just needs time to come back.” A flurry of footsteps approached the kitchen door once again, and the same golden haired tachi appeared, “GUYS! You still have an extra set of food, right? Forget about Nue! Aruji is back!” Sunset in the citadel is always particularly beautiful. As the sun disappear behind the forest, the citadel bathed in gorgeous streaks of red and gold. Looking at the disappearing sun, Yamanbagiri squinted hard. “You will hurt your eyes if you do that, brother!” Yamabushi boisterous voice makes him flinch. Scooting away, the hooded sword makes room for his brother. “You seem distracted since yesterday, brother. Is there anything bothering you?” Small breeze passing by, making the leaves rustles and sway slowly. Isn’t this exactly what happen a few years ago? When the citadel is still small and the Saniwa is still around. Both of them always took their time to sit at the engawa and watch the sun set. “I wonder… why aruji left us so often?” he whispered. Yamabushi smiled, “To become stronger, sometimes we must go on a journey to temper ourself. Our blacksmith, Kunihiro, also made his best swords during his journeys. I’m sure, the journey that aruji went on has a purpose to become stronger.” Yamanbagiri pulls down his hood. He hates that his brother is right. “HMPH!” The teal haired tachi stood up abruptly, “Just like this muscle! If I didn’t train it, it won’t get bigger and stronger. Maybe I should go on a journey to the mountains myself! KAKAKAKA!” Yamanbagiri shakes his head, “Your laugh is still as loud as ever, brother.” He said with exasperation. He stood up and starts to walk to the direction of dining hall. Yamabushi tailing him with a big smile. As he come near the dining hall, he saw almost everyone already arrived and seated. The kitchen team is still busy moving foods with the help of Shishiou. In the corner of his eyes, he saw Nihongo and Jiroutachi sneakily bringing a jug of sake to the dining hall. It seems he needs to escort the tantous away quickly after dinner before the two drunkards become wasted. Yamanbagiri choose a seat near the door, which also the seat closest to where the Saniwa usually eats. The food is already distributed, consisting of a bowl of rice, fish, soup and two vegetable dishes. Low chatters and murmurs fill the hall. Izuminokami animatedly talking with his fellow Shinsengumi sword members, while the Toushirou Tantous and other tantous discussing which game they will play tomorrow. The two drunkards of the citadel, Jiroutachi and Nihongou talks in hushed voice, but the grin on their faces indicating they are plotting something. Beside them, Tsurumaru also nods in approval from time to time. Suddenly, Yamanbagiri heard a commotion from the furthest end of the dining hall. “Aruji?” “It’s Aruji!” “The Saniwa is back?!” He vaguely heard. He faintly heard familiar footstep approaching his side. A silhouette moving through the thin shoji door. The shadow stopped right before the door. He heard Shishiou’s voice talking with the shadow before dashing to the direction of the kitchen. Everyone’s eyes glued to the shoji door in anticipation. The door opened. “Aruji!” A young man in his early twenty stepped into the dining hall. He wears a blue and black hakama with teal haori adorned with silver embroidery of bamboo. The yellow fox, Konnosuke, following behind him. The man swept his eyes around the dining hall, and then bowing his head slightly. “I’m back, everyone. I’m sorry for my long absence.” The man sits down. “My departure last time was very abrupt, so I will try to stay longer this time. I hope you don’t mind.” He shows a small smile. Some tantou already burst into tears and ready to pounce on the saniwa. Other swords either let out a relieved sigh or a small smile too. Hasebe may have silently cry. Yamanbagiri couldn’t confirm it since the sword hunched his back so deep. Four swords arrived at the dining hall, Shokudaikiri, Kasen, Souza and Shishiou. The one-eyed sword bringing a tray with a dinner set and placed it in front of the Saniwa. “Welcome back, Aruji. I was worried something had happened to you... That's right. A lot of people here feel pretty down if you're not around.” Sokudaikiri said. The saniwa chuckled, “I’m sorry, I will definitely make it up for my absence.” After everyone has been seated, the Saniwa cleared his throat, “Since everyone is here, let’s eat together. Itadakimasu.” “ITADAKIMASU!”
