At the time Valentine Event occured, I noticed there's no Chocolate Episode for Rio...
I thought to myself, "it is what it is," but I feel dejected about it, so I tried to make a Valentine story with Rio.
I made the story as I go, and so it resulted in this two short stories, but I hope you enjoy it.
