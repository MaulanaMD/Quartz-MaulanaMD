This works contains a small amount of detail mentioned in the Blue Archive Main Story, Eden Treaty Chapter 4 (Kyrie of the Forgotten Gods), but it still can be enjoyed even if you haven't read said chapter.

While there's no spoiler in it, I thought reading this after ~~done the Kyrie (chapter 4)~~ finishing Chapter 4 might make this book even more interesting.

Thank you for coming here, Sensei

~~-words of pleasantries-~~ I'm sorry for borrowing your time.

There's something I need you to listen to.

Truth to be told,

~~the scale (of the problem) isn't that big yet.~~ It's not that huge of a problem yet.

There's a preparation of a certain party in Trinity,

and Mika was recruited as a volunteer for that.

She's in charge of the venue's decoration,

but it seems that it's not going well for her.

If you're willing to, can you help Mika?

So then you came to help as asked by Seia?

Yes, I am.

That's why, Mika,

Let's do our best.
Y- Yeah.

And then...

That's why...

Uh...

I'm sorry,

for you to be called just ~~for this~~ because of this

Even though I supposed to work this out by myself...

If it's for Mika, I'll come anytime.

You've been doing this all alone,

I'd like you to be relying on me more.

Also..

I'll do my best.

Finally,

I swear, it's really tiring.

Right, sensei?

You did great, thanks for the hard work.

*Ehem*

Everyone, thank you so much.

Because this is volunteer work, there's no reward for it,

but ~~at least if this can deepen everyone's friendship, that makes me glad~~ if this can deepen your relationship with each other, that'll make me glad.

Sensei,

Um...

I'm sorry.

I do feel bad, but I have a meeting with Seia **after this**.

It's about the party.

Then, how about Mika-sama?

...I think I'll pass on it as well.

Maybe on another occasion then…
