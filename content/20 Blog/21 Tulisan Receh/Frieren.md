# Frieren, Existentialism, and Legacy

English article.

Let’s talk about Frieren, shall we?

I have been meaning to write an analysis (yes, analysis, not review) about Sousou no Frieren for a while, but never got into actually writing it. The flame was rekindled after I finally finished watching the anime a week ago and talking a bit about it with my friends. All I can say is that the anime did the manga justice, from pacing to upgrading the consumption experience into an audiovisual medium.

There’s two aspect of Frieren that stands out to me after several times reading and watching it, and you might’ve guessed it by reading the title of this article: it’s way of highlighting everyday adventure and stories (existentialism) and the power of a legacy.

Let’s talk about them one by one.

## Frieren and Existentialism

From the start, Frieren is filled with the *stories of everyday life*, one that is as ordinary as it is for a wandering party of adventurer. The premise of “the party that defeated demon lord is coming back to the Capital” with a twist really fits this way of storytelling—we were given a reason to highlight that “everydayness”.

After everything has been done and ended, each member goes on with their own lives. Himmel stays in the capital and done checkups here and there to maintain the peace in the southern lands, Heiter goes on to be archbishop, and Eisen & Frieren go wander doing their own things–Eisen seeking a disciple (I forgot if that’s what he does immediately or not after the disbandment of the party), and Frieren searching for yet more grimoire and tomes. There’s no continuation of their adventure as a group, yet live goes on. A promise to reunite 50 years later, to watch the meteor shower, is the only thing keeping them together. After Himmel’s death, we finally got the final piece of the premise–hoping for a reunion, Frieren seeks on an adventure to Ende.

But a story needs a listener, a witness. For some amount of chapter later on, the story focuses on Frieren gathering companion for her adventures. And those were the disciples of her former comrade, people who have one-degree separation with her and Himmel. We’ll talk about this again later in more depth, but the point is, the story and Frieren herself need companion in her journey, as someone who kinda gets the context of the Hero Party but still not know about it enough, as our representation, a reason for Frieren to talk or reminiscence about her days in the Hero Party. That’s not say Fern & Stark’s role (and Sein, too) is merely a witness for Frieren. They also have their own perspective, their own story, their own selves. It is, in the end, not a story about Frieren or her days as member of Hero Party, but the story of a bunch of companions who tries to understand and know each other.

What drives the theme of existentialism—that life, especially daily and everyday life, matters as much as the one that stands out as an exceptional happening—is the highlight of their journey. Inbetween notable events, the stories still highlight some moments in their journey, but rather than presenting it as a filler, it was showcased as an important storytelling aspect. If you were considering it as a filler episode, then basically most of the first half of the first anime season are just filler. It is that important.

But you probably won’t think about it like that anyway. The lines between important stuff, like the meeting with other important characters, such as when Frieren and Fern met with Stark or when the trio came to Sein’s village, and other
