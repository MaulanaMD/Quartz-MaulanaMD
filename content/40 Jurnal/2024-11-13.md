Writing this in case I forgot about it. Got reminded of it because of Damon’s repost of Lain’s post on Fedi, it’s what I talked on monday late at night.

At the end of the day, my rejection of attachment toward some kind of identity is mostly because I don’t want to be shackled by the consequences, that I could only pursue **that** and only that is/was related to said identity. I do see the need of it from social perspective, especially as a way of showing to others who you are, what you do, etc. But other than that, I can’t feel bothered to describe myself into one or more identity. I am all what I do, and that full, whole acceptance of who I am is all that I needed for myself.
